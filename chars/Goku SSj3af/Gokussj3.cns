;Crouching light punch
; CNS difficulty: easy
; Description: Simple crouching attack. The HitDef's guardflag parameter
;     is set to "L", meaning that the move can only be guarded low
;     (crouching), and not by standing or jumping opponents.
;     Like for all light attacks, it's a good idea to keep the slidetime
;     and hittime parameters at a smaller number, so the opponent isn't
;     stunned for too long. For all crouching attacks you have to
;     remember to set the attr parameter to indicate that it is crouching
;     attack. In this case, "C, NA" stands for "crouching, normal attack".
;     The HitDef's priority is set at 3, instead of the default of 4,
;     so this attack has a lower priority than most others, meaning
;     KFM will get hit instead of trading hits with his opponent if
;     their attack collision boxes (Clsn1) intersect each other's Clsn2
;     boxes at the same time.

;Crouching strong punch
; CNS difficulty: easy
; Description: This is a 2-hit move. It is done by having two HitDefs
;     triggered, one for each frame of animation that hits.
;     Notice how the first hit cannot be guarded by an opponent in the
;     air, because of the "M" in the guardflag, meaning it can only
;     be guarded "middle". The second hit has an "MA" guardflag, so
;     it can be guarded both on the ground and in the air.
; CNS レベル: 易
; 詳細: これは殴打が二発ある攻撃です。
; 殴打できるアニメーションの枚は一々HitDefを登録しています。
; 一発目の攻撃のHitDefにはguardflagが「M」（middle＝中段ガード）
; にセットされているので、相手は空中でガードできません。二発目
; の攻撃のguardflagは「MA」（middle+air＝中段＋空中ガード）で、
; 地上、空中でもガードすることができます。

; Description: This move uses "Trip" for the "ground.type" parameter in
;     its HitDef. It's a special type that puts the opponent in a tripped
;     animation as he falls. Also, the hitflag parameter in the HitDef
;     is set to "MAFD". The "D" indicates that a downed opponent can be
;     hit by the attack.

;Kung Fu Throw - Attempt
; CNS difficulty: medium-advanced
; Description: Throws are not difficult to make, although then can be
;     tedious at times. Throw attempt states have a HitDef of a
;     special format. The key parameters in a throw are p1stateno
;     and p2stateno. If the HitDef successfully connects, then
;     the attacker will change to the state number specified by
;     p1stateno, and the opponent will be change to the state
;     number assigned to p2stateno. The special thing about p2stateno
;     is that the opponent will be temporarily brought into the
;     attacker's state file. In this case, no matter who the
;     opponent is, he will be taken to state 820 of this file (kfm.cns)
;     and remain here until the end of the throw (look at his debug
;     information when he is being thrown; the text changes to yellow
;     to mean that he is in another player's state file).

sprpriority = 2

; Notes: The '-' symbol in the hitflag field means that it only affects
;   players who are not in a hit state. This prevents KFM from combo-ing
;   into the throw. The priority should be set to a low number, such as
;   1 or 2, so that the throw does not take precedence over normal attacks.
;   The type of priority must always be set to "Miss" or "Dodge" for throws,
;   otherwise strange behavior can result.

;Kung Fu Throw - Throwing the opponent
; Description: In this state, KFM throws the opponent by binding him to
;     various offsets based on his current frame of animation. For
;     example, [State 810, Bind 1] binds the opponent to an offset of
;     28 pixels in front of KFM. That puts him around where KFM's hand
;     is at. Is is important to keep the opponent bound using a
;     TargetBind controller at all times, until you let him go. This
;     is especially important if your player has a Clsn2 box that
;     allows him to get hit while throwing someone. Each time a player
;     gets hit, all his bound targets will be set to a fall state. If
;     the opponent is not bound, then he may get stuck in his thrown
;     state when his attacker is knocked out of the throw halfway.
; Notes: There is a TargetLifeAdd controller to decrease the opponent's
;     life, and a TargetState controller to change his state to a
;     falling state when KFM lets go of him.

; (a custom gethit state)

;     whereas ChangeAnim always changes the player to an action in his

; Description: This is like a standard attack, but with some differences.
;   There are two HitDefs in this attack. One is triggered when the
;   opponent is near (using a p2bodydist trigger), and the other
;   when the opponent is farther away. The main differences between
;   the near and far versions of the HitDefs is that the near version
;   has a "fall" parameter set to 1, causing the opponent to be knocked
;   down. Other minor differences are the damage, and the velocity to
;   give the opponent.
;   The line "attr = S, SA" line means this is a Standing, Special Attack.
;   It is important you have the attr parameter set correctly for all
;   you HitDefs.

; Kung Fu Knee
; CNS difficulty: medium
; Description: Like the Kung Fu Palm, this is a special attack. This attack
;     begins on the ground, launches KFM into the air, then ends when KFM
;     lands on the ground. To achieve this, we use three states. The first
;     has KFM starting on the ground (note that type = S in the Statedef).
;     The ChangeState controller brings KFM into the second state (state
;     1051) when his ground animation ends. The second state controls KFM's
;     movement into the air and back towards the ground. The last state
;     (state 1052) stops KFM from moving when he touches the ground, and
;     brings him back to his stand state (state 0) when the animation is
;     over. More details are given in comments before each of the following
;     states.

; Light Kung Fu Knee - jump
; Description: This state uses a velset parameter in the Statedef to make
;     KFM move upwards. A value of 2,-6 means 2 pixels/tick forwards, and
;     6 pixels/tick upwards. Since this is an aerial state, the type is set
;     to A in the Statedef.
;     Notice that physics = N (N for None) here. This means we are not using
;     the built-in aerial physics model (physics = A), so we have complete
;     control over what KFM does in this state. Since we do not have
;     physics = A to take care of gravity for us, we need to put in our own
;     controller for that. Controller 1051,1 does the work of pulling KFM
;     down towards the ground. Controller 1051,2 checks if KFM has reached
;     the ground, and changes to state 1052 if so.
;     In this state's Statedef, we will use the hitdefpersist parameter to
;     retain the HitDef information from the last state. If we did not have
;     hitdefpersist, the HitDef will be turned off between state changes.

;     number greater than -10 upon entering this state (see the ChangeState

; Light Kung Fu Upper
; CNS difficulty: easy
; Description: This is a simple special attack that can hit twice. Notice
;     the use of the Width controller to keep opponents from getting too
;     close to KFM during his uppercut (press Ctrl-C, and look at the
;     yellow bar at KFM's feet during the move).
;     The second HitDef has some interesting parameters. fall.recovertime
;     is used to prevent the opponent (p2) from recovering immediately
;     after being hit (eg. press x+y with KFM to recover). This gives the
;     attacking KFM a chance to follow up with an extra attack, such as
;     a Kung Fu Knee. The yaccel parameter, set at 0.4, makes p2 fall at a
;     greater value of acceleration than the default, which is 0.35.

; Smash Kung Fu Upper (hyper)
; CNS difficulty: medium
; Description: This is very similar to KFM's Strong and Light Kung Fu Uppers.
;     There is just one HitDef, for a screen-shaking hit. The envshake
;     parameters are used to make this effect. You can find out more about
;     each parameter in the CNS documentation.
;     The fall.recover parameter is set at 0, meaning that p2 cannot recover
;     from the fall by entering his recovery command (for KFM, that is x+y).
;     This gives the attacking KFM a chance to follow up with another attack,
;     such as the Fast Kung Fu Palm.
;     Note that there is a ChangeState controller used to make KFM change to
;     a success state if he hits. The success state has KFM hold his arm
;     up longer for a dramatic effect.
