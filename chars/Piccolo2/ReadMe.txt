	An overview description for this character is needed.
	Need Piccolo's Japanese voices from Budokai.
	Last remaining moves for Piccolo cannot be completed, until the sprites have been made.
	Pallettes not working in LinuxMugen. This will be fixed later.
	Some projectile issues; Helpers not behaving exactly as intended.
	Perhaps some bugs I have overlooked when optimizing the code.
	A bunch of issues when trying to press 2 directional commands at the same time to fly. >_<
