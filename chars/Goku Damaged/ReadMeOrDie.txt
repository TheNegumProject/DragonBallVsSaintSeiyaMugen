Hey yo people!

Version 0.1b is here, it's the second release of Goku. Only a few new things are included, but the smaller fixes
makes him more enjoyable.

[Bugfixes/Tweaks]--------------------------------------------------------
-Adjusted damage amounts for Quick Kame and Combo Rush X
-Added a smaller jump if you don't hold the up button during jump
-Added Foward/Backward dodge ("F,F" or "B,B")
-CLSN boxes are now 100% adjusted


[What's New]--------------------------------------------------------------

-Artifical Intelligence
Description:
If you fight againts the computer, it will control Goku like an intelligent player, not like an idiot (or who knows :P)

-One Button Combo System V.2
Description:
My Broly's trademark system is back, and better than ever! If you press one button 3  times, you'll do
a short combo with a finish or launcher at the end, and this works even in chrouching state! You can link
the system's second move as the first move, weaker to stronger, punch to kick, stand to crouch. If you
link a stronger move to a weaker move you'll do it's finish/launcher instantly.
Max Damage: Go ahead, count it
Power: No power needed
Components:
A system (crouch only yet, 25% done)
B system (stand only yet, 50% done)
C system (not done)
X system (not done)
Y system (not done)

[What's Done]--------------------------------------------------------------

[--Supers--]:

KI Supers:

-Quick KameHameHa
Description:
Goku charges some KI in his hands, and then launches a short wave of energy towards the opponent. 
Can change directions (up, down, or straight), with the respective directional buttons.
Max Damage: 91
Power     : -1000
Key config: D, DB, B, a (+up/down)

Combo Rushes:

-Combo Rush (X)
Description:
Goku gives the opponent some punches to the face, then performs an uppercut, and as a finish, he
teleports up, then smacks the poor foe down to the ground. BUT... you can  cancel the super after the
uppercut to a Quick KameHameHa, to deal some more damage.
Max Damage: 129/190 with movecancel
Power     : -1000/ -2000 with movecancel
Key Config: D, DF, F, x 

[--Basics--]

-Basic combo system
Description: 
No extra, weaker to stronger moves, standing moves to chrouching moves. Kicks are count
as stronger moves. So you can link a Weak punch to a Weak Kick, but you can't do this backwards.

-Launchers
Description:
You can use these moves to send your opponent flying high to the air. The one with a+b is 
a kick (stronger, launches higher), and the one with x+y is a punch (weaker, can linked more times). 
They can be used with the basic combo system, as the strongest level of moves.
Key Config: a+b/x+y

Haha, do you think I'll tell you that if you hold down button c during the crouching leg sweep, you'll do a 
kick while you pull your leg back? Ha!...Oh shi...
